# Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard


This Power BI dashboard is designed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The goal is to identify key business insights and optimization opportunities across different outlets, item types, and customer preferences.

The report uses interactive visualizations to analyze KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items Sold, and Average Customer Rating. These insights help Blinkit make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience and optimize sales strategies across various outlet types, sizes, and locations.

# STEPS FOLLOWED
## Step 1: Requirement Gathering / Business Understanding

The objective was to evaluate Blinkit's performance by analyzing sales, inventory, and customer satisfaction across different product and outlet dimensions. Key stakeholder requirements were identified, focusing on:

- Sales trends by product attributes (fat content, item type)

- Outlet-specific performance

- Rating-based customer satisfaction analysis
 
## Step 2: Data Walkthrough
The dataset was explored to understand its structure, data types, null values, and relationships. It included fields such as Item Type, Fat Content, Outlet Size, Establishment Year, Sales, and Rating.

## Step 3: Data Connection
The dataset (in CSV format) was imported into Power BI Desktop.

## Step 4: Data Cleaning / Quality Check
- Checked column distribution, quality, and profiles.

- Removed or ignored null and duplicate values.

- Validated the consistency of categories (e.g., "Low Fat", "Regular").

- Ensured rating values were within acceptable bounds (e.g., 0â€“5 scale).

## Step 5: Data Modeling
- Relationships were created between fact and dimension tables.

- Data types were properly assigned for each field (Date, Numeric, Text).

- Created a clean data model for efficient reporting.

## Step 6: Data Processing
- Aggregated necessary metrics like total sales, average ratings, etc.

- Created calculated columns for improved slicing and dicing.

  ## Step 7: DAX Calculations
New measures were created for:

- Total Sales = SUM(Sales)

A clean and user-friendly single-page layout was adopted with color coding by category (fat content, outlet type, etc.). The theme aligned with Blinkit's brand tone.

## Step 9: Chart Development & Formatting
The following visuals were developed:

- Donut Chart â€“ Total Sales by Fat Content

âž¤ Shows contribution of fat content types to overall sales.

## Step 10: Dashboard / Report Development

- Final visuals were added with proper formatting, labels, legends, and slicers.
